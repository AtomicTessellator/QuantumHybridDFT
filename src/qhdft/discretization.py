# Stage 1: System Discretization and Setup
# This stage establishes the numerical grid for representing the quantum system in Density Functional Theory (DFT).
# We create a fine grid for accurate Hamiltonian discretization and a coarse set of interpolation points centered at atoms
# to reduce computational complexity from O(Ng) to O(NI), where Ng is the number of grid points (~ number of electrons Ne)
# and NI is the number of interpolation points (~ number of atoms Na). This enables linear scaling in quantum algorithms.
# The initial electron density is approximated as a superposition of Gaussians around atomic positions, normalized to integrate to Ne.
# Shape functions (Gaussians) are used for interpolation between coarse and fine grids, ensuring accurate density reconstruction.
